      Hello, my name is Ken Eucker. I love to design applications, write poetry, bicycle to parks,
      kayak on rivers, hike to hot springs, backpack through canyons, take candid photographs, and
      talk about the intersection of technology and psychology. This document outlines who I am as a
      developer who collaborates on open source projects, where you can find me on the web, and a
      couple of things about me that you may find commonality with.

        I currently live in Portland, Oregon and work remotely with clients and colleagues from all
        over the world. If you're biking around the city I am in you just might run into me. ;)<br />
        On the internet I keep things pretty simple and use my first and last name most places, so
        I've got https://keneucker.com as a general landing page, but if you're looking for me
        elsewhere just try my name.

        I work well with direct communication and honesty, and also with asynchronous communication.
        Direct messages and emails allow me to prioritize my present moment and gives me an
        opportunity to respond at a time when my full attention can be given to the conversation. If
        you can, please let me know; what you have, what you are looking to achieve, how I can help, 
        and any expectations you might have for my response. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I am often focused and intentional in how I go about my day so a laugh, walk around the block, 
        or nice chat over a meal is a welcomed opportunity to get to know me better. We all have good 
        and bad days, productive days and days where you spend the entire time blocked. I find that 
        there are times when I am more available for random chats and distractions, and that there are 
        times when I am best left to my own schedule with my head down on the task at hand. I rarely 
        take myself "offline", but I will let you know quite immediately if I am too busy to connect.

        I really enjoy helping people become more efficient at what they are doing and providing
        solutions for people when they have an idea of what they want with what they have. Software
        Engineering projects aside, I also like to make myself available to actively participate in
        my community and environment. I think it's important to have support roles in every group
        and am a willing volunteer for most positions both in a professional and personal capacity.
        I make a good second in command and an even better self starting laborer. I think
        collaboration and communication are the best ways to accomplish a task with others and I
        have found a lot of success in talking through my thought process with others. We're all in
        this together. In addition to my software skills, I also have a fair amount of experience
        helping people in other ways. I have participated in building and supporting the;
        transportation, setup and teardown of large scale interactive art. I have lead small group
        bicycle tours, individual cycling adventures, and mass city-wide cycling events. I have
        joined peer support roles at various events and functions, ranging from de-escalation to
        incident command management.

        My schedule changes a lot with the seasons, but there are several constants to how I spend
        my time. One of those constats is riding my bicycle. I bike commute and travel with a
        backback and two waterbottles in the summertime, and I bike commute in the winter with
        raingear and two panniers. I like to ride for fun, for errands, with groups, and totally
        alone. I also really love to go kayaking on rivers and lakes all over the Pacific Northwest,
        and have made it a constant to meditate on the river at least once a month. It is my goal to
        have paddled in every body of water in Oregon.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also like to be out in the woods on trails, campsites, near mountains, and on rivers. I
        like to sit and stare at viewpoints high and low while having philisophical conversations
        about everything in life from feelings to adventures to technology and the study of all
        things. I like to work on crafts, tinker with electronics, and build things out of wood or
        metal or glass or ceramic. I like to take photographs and have been learning how to fly +
        shoot video with a drone.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also spend a lot of time on my computer when I'm not out and about, creating software
        solutions for problems big and small or non-existant at all. I am constantly learning. I
        find web development to be a lot of fun and I'll create new websites regularly without much
        thought. My career is important to me and I spend a lot of time discovering new platforms
        and programming techniques in order to grow my skills and knowledge. I find my work to be
        rewarding, creative, and inspiring in a lot of ways.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am nomadic. I love to travel and be in a constant state of movement, at times of my life.
        As a self employed engineer, I work 100% remotely for all of my clients and prefer this to
        any other working arrangement. I have had the privilege of being able to travel and work at
        the same time and I feel that all people who only need a laptop and the internet to complete
        their work deserve the same privilege.
